## Pilot 1

A pilot test of the 2-stage (prior + posterior) task.
4 trials / participant
Posterior task is: Speaker / listener between-subjects.
- one story, one distribution, one frequency (when speaker)

n = 9 ($0.50)

+ 63 ($37.80) [7 batches of 9]

## Pilot 2

Similar to pilot 1.
Removed a bunch of the prose, and beefed up the tabular representation of the data.
(Note: May want to run a comprehension check on their "table reading" skills.)

4 trials / participant (as before)

Now, prior task is a separate between-subjects condition, so each participant does only prior, listener, or speaker task.
Prior task also is not "structured prior" used in Prior 1. It's just a posterior predictive question.
Speaker task is also a slider (to get more bits from pilot data; plan is to return to 2AFC in final production version, for ease of data analysis).

Dropping pay a little because there are substantially fewer questions.

n = 63 ($30.24, including fees) [7 batches of 9]
